## Instructions

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

## How The Game Works

- Player selection: allow the user to select the image for the player character before starting the game. 
- You can implement a score for the game. For example, the score can increase each time the player reaches the water, and it can be reset to 0 when collision occurs
